"""Transparency module for importing the chosen search engine.

This module imports the ``elasticsearch``/``opensearchpy`` and
``elasticsearch_dsl``/``opensearch_dsl`` packages based on availability,
and provides them as ``search`` and ``dsl`` respectively.
The aim of this is to make the choice of the search engine (Elasticsearch
vs. OpenSearch) more transparent.
