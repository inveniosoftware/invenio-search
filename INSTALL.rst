Installation
============

Invenio-Search is on PyPI. When you install Invenio-Search you must specify the
appropriate extras dependency for the version of Elasticsearch or OpenSearch you use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # For Elasticsearch 7.x:
    $ pip install invenio-search[elasticsearch7]

    $ # For OpenSearch 1.x:
    $ pip install invenio-search[opensearch1]

Also note that installing multiple conflicting dependencies (e.g.
`invenio-search[opensearch1,elasticsearch7]`) will result in an error at runtime.
